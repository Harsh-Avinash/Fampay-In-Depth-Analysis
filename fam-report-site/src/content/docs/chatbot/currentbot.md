---
This report provides an analysis of the FamPay chatbot, focusing on its structure of suggested questions and answers, and the option to connect with support. The goal is to identify areas of strength and potential improvement to enhance user experience and engagement.

### Chatbot Response Analysis

#### 1. Suggested Questions and Answers

The chatbot's suggested questions and answers format is effective for guiding users through common queries. However, it may limit the chatbot's ability to handle more complex or unique user queries.

#### 2. Connection to Support

The chatbot's ability to connect users to support is a valuable feature, especially when it fails to resolve a user's query. However, the transition from chatbot to human support could be smoother.

### Observation of Chatbot Responses

| Feature | Effectiveness | User Experience | Transition to Support |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Suggested Questions and Answers | Good | Good | Fair |
| Connection to Support | Excellent | Excellent | -- |

### Identified Issues

#### 1. Incorrect Company Name in Service Ticket

The service ticket generated after a conversation with a representative still refers to the company as FamPay, even though the company has rebranded to FamApp.

#### 2. Misleading Information About Account Upgrades

The chatbot provided misleading information about account upgrades. It stated that turning 18 would automatically upgrade account limits, which is incorrect. The actual requirement for an upgrade is purchasing the FamX Ultra subscription.

```
Your account limits vary depending on whether you have
a subscription or not
Since you do not have a subscription, your limits are
- per month and per year for loading
- balance limit
You can change/upgrade your limits in the following
scenarios:
- You can upgrade your limits if you buy FamX Ultra
- If you turn 18, your limits get upgraded.
```

### 3. UI Overlap Issue

The chatbox UI is overlapped by the keyboard, making it difficult for users to view and interact with the chatbot.

Here is the chatbox without the keyboard:

Now with the keyboard:

### Conclusion

The FamPay chatbot is a valuable tool for guiding users through common queries and connecting them to support when necessary. However, there are areas where it could be improved. By focusing on these areas, FamApp can enhance the user experience and increase engagement.
