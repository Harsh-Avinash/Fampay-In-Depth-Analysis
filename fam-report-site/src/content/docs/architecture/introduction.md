Greetings Team Fam,

My name is Harsh Avinash, and I am currently in the final year of my Computer Science Engineering degree, specializing in Data Science, at Vellore Institute of Technology. I am also a seasoned Data Engineer and Product Manager with a robust track record in multiple roles across the tech industry. 

Over the past month, I've committed myself to explore Fam's ecosystem, resulting in the detailed report that lies ahead of you. This process has allowed me to delve into various aspects of your operations, providing me with a profound understanding and appreciation of your work. 

I've primarily focused my analysis on six key areas: 

* **App Review Analytics**
* **Competition Analysis**
* **Chatbot**
* **Information**
* **Social Media Analytics**
* **Website Analytics**

My goal is to present findings that can foster enhanced user experiences, streamline operations, and help shape strategic decisions.

With my academic credentials, professional experiences, and comprehensive skillset, I believe I could be a valuable addition to your team as a Product Analyst. I hope this report showcases not only my analytical skills and attention to detail but also my keen interest in Fam and the FinTech industry.
