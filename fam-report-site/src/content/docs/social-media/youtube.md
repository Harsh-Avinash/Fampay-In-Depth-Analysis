I see that you're conducting an extensive analysis of YouTube videos data for a given channel, in this case, FamPay's channel. Here is a description of your process and code snippets, as you have requested.

### **1\. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**

The first part of my analysis involved gathering and preprocessing the data for analysis. I used Google's YouTube Data API v3 to fetch data about the channel and its videos.

Here is a brief summary of the code I used to extract data:

```python
# Set up the YouTube API client
api_key = ""
youtube = googleapiclient.discovery.build("youtube", "v3", developerKey=api_key)

# Specify the channel custom URL
channel_custom_url = "https://www.youtube.com/@yougotfam"
```

<div style="overflow: auto; height: auto">
<pre>
Channel name: Fam India
Channel description: FamX by Fam, is India’s first Spending Account made for everyone.

Number of subscribers: 56300
Total number of views: 2612678
</pre>
</div>

In this process, I first configured the YouTube API client and then defined the target channel's URL. Afterward, I made a series of API calls to fetch data about the channel and its videos, including each video's title, views, likes, comments, and captions.

This data is essential because it helps to understand which videos are performing well (based on metrics such as views and likes) and which ones are not. This can be invaluable in driving future content strategy.

### **2\. Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters**

Once I had extracted and cleaned up the data, the next step was to find patterns or groupings in the data. For this, I used a technique known as clustering.

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method used to segment the data into different groups (clusters) so that data points in the same group are similar to each other and dissimilar to data points in other groups. In the context of our YouTube video data, we're clustering the video titles based on their text features.

Here is the code snippet for this section:

```python
# Vectorize the video titles
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(video_titles)

# Apply K-means clustering
num_clusters = 5
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)
```

In this section, I used TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform the text data of the video titles into a format that can be understood by the machine learning model. Then, I used the KMeans clustering algorithm from the scikit-learn library to group the data into five clusters.

### **3\. Clustering and Visualization**

After creating the clusters, I wanted to visualize the average likes for each cluster. This allows us to see which clusters, and by extension, which types of video titles, tend to receive more likes on average.

Here is the code snippet:

```python
# Assign cluster labels to the dataframe
df['cluster_label'] = kmeans.labels_

# Calculate the average likes for each cluster
cluster_likes = df.groupby('cluster_label')['likes'].mean()

# Plotting
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Bar(x=cluster_likes.index, y=cluster_likes.values))
```

Here, I first assigned the generated cluster labels back to the original dataframe. Then, I calculated the mean likes for each cluster and visualized this using a bar plot.

From this plot, we can observe which clusters (or video title categories) are, on average, more liked by viewers.

### **4\. Cluster Analysis**

The final part of my analysis was to identify the topics in the best and worst-performing clusters. This information can provide insights into what type of content resonates most and least with viewers.

```python
# Get the cluster labels for the best and worst performing clusters
worst_cluster = cluster_likes.idxmin()
best_cluster = cluster_likes.idxmax()
```

From the output, we can see the titles of the videos that belong to the most and least liked clusters. This analysis can give us clues about what content viewers are most interested in and what types of videos might need rethinking or improvement.


```python
df['cluster_label'] = kmeans.labels_
# Scatter plot with color-coded clusters
fig = px.scatter(df, x='views', y='likes', color='cluster_label')
fig.update_layout(title='Views and Likes for Each Video',
                  xaxis_title='Views',
                  yaxis_title='Likes')
pio.write_html(fig, file='../../fam-report-site/public/Social-Analytics/views_likes_by_cluster.html', auto_open=True)
fig.show()
```

### **Results**

After conducting this analysis, we have a clearer understanding of which video topics are generally well-received (and which are not) based on the cluster analysis of video titles and likes.

This methodology of using clustering to analyze video performance based on text features of video titles is quite effective in understanding content performance and viewer preferences. By grouping similar videos together, we can make more targeted strategies for content creation and viewer engagement.

All the visualizations are saved as HTML files and can be embedded into web pages using iframes, as shown in the markdown text above. This allows the insights gained from the analysis to be shared and viewed in a more interactive manner.
