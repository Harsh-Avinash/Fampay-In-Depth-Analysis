In this analysis, I have used a simple yet effective method to evaluate the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) score of various web pages related to FamPay. SEO is a crucial aspect of digital marketing and web development, as it directly impacts the visibility of a website on search engine results. A higher SEO score generally means that the webpage is more likely to appear in the top results of a search engine, thereby attracting more organic traffic.

The SEO score in this analysis is calculated based on the length of the title tag and the meta description of a webpage. The title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a webpage, and it is displayed on search engine results pages as the clickable headline for a given result. The meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of the content of a webpage. It is commonly used on search engine results pages to display preview snippets for a given page.

The rationale behind using the length of the title and meta description to calculate the SEO score is that both of these elements play a significant role in search engine ranking algorithms. For instance, a title that accurately and succinctly describes the content of a page can improve its relevance to specific search queries, thereby improving its search engine ranking. Similarly, a well-written meta description can increase the click-through rate of a webpage on search engine results pages, which can also contribute to a higher search engine ranking.

## Code Explanation and Results

First, I read a list of URLs from a CSV file:

```python
urls = pd.read_csv("../../Website-Analytics/EveryTraceOfFampayPeriod/filtered_links.csv")

```

Then, for each URL, I calculated the SEO score and stored the results in a DataFrame:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["URL", "SEO Score"])

for url in urls["Link"]:
    seo_score = get_seo_score(url)
    df = df.append({"URL": url, "SEO Score": seo_score}, ignore_index=True)

```

Next, I created three plots to visualize the results:

1.  **Histogram of SEO scores**: This plot provides an overview of the distribution of SEO scores across all web pages. It can help identify common patterns or outliers in the SEO scores.

```python
fig1 = px.histogram(df, x="SEO Score")

```

2.  **Top 30 URLs with the highest SEO scores**: This plot highlights the web pages with the highest SEO scores. These pages are likely to have well-optimized title tags and meta descriptions.

```python
top30_df = df.sort_values("SEO Score", ascending=False).head(30)
fig2 = px.bar(top30_df, x="URL", y="SEO Score", title="Top 30 URLs with Highest SEO Score")

```
<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/top10_seo_scores.html"></iframe>

3.  **Top 30 URLs with the lowest SEO scores**: This plot highlights the web pages with the lowest SEO scores. These pages may need improvements in their title tags and meta descriptions to enhance their SEO.

```python
bottom30_df = df.sort_values("SEO Score").head(30)
fig3 = px.bar(bottom30_df, x="URL", y="SEO Score", title="Top 30 URLs with Lowest SEO Score")

```
<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/bottom10_seo_scores.html"></iframe>

By analyzing these plots, we can gain insights into the SEO performance of FamPay's web pages and identify areas for improvement. For instance, web pages with low SEO scores could be optimized by improving the quality and relevance of their title tags and meta descriptions. On the other hand, web pages with highSEO scores can serve as examples of good SEO practices that can be replicated across other pages.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this SEO analysis provides valuable insights into the visibility of FamPay's web pages on search engines. By identifying the pages with the highest and lowest SEO scores, we can prioritize our SEO efforts to maximize the organic traffic to FamPay's website. This analysis also underscores the importance of well-crafted title tags and meta descriptions in improving a webpage's search engine ranking.

Remember, SEO is a continuous process. It's not a one-time task but requires regular monitoring and optimization to keep up with changes in search engine algorithms and user behavior. Therefore, this analysis should be repeated periodically to track the progress of our SEO efforts and to identify new opportunities for improvement.
