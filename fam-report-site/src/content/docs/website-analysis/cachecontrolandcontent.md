title: "Analysis of Caching and Content-Encoding Metrics"
description: "Docs intro"
---

During the process of this analysis, I have chosen to focus on two crucial web metrics: caching and content encoding. These metrics are particularly important as they significantly influence the user experience by impacting the load time and performance of a web page.

Caching is an essential feature implemented on web servers and clients to store copies of web resources like HTML pages, images, and files for faster access in future requests. The Cache-Control header provides caching directives, which helps in reducing the load time and bandwidth usage.

Content-Encoding, on the other hand, is a characteristic of the data being sent by the server to the client, which specifies the type of transformation that has been applied to the data. This is often used to allow data to be compressed to speed up the transfer, significantly impacting the overall page load time and performance.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preparation

The first step of the analysis was data collection. To do so, I loaded the csv file containing the unique links associated with FamPay. For each of these links, I sent a GET request and recorded the responses. The information I was interested in was the Cache-Control, Expires, and Content-Encoding headers from the responses. These were stored in a separate DataFrame and saved as a CSV file for further analysis.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('../EveryTraceOfFampayPeriod/famapp_unique_links.csv')
...
response = requests.get(link)
cache_control = response.headers.get('Cache-Control')
expires = response.headers.get('Expires')
content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding')
```

## Distribution of Content-Encoding Values

With the collected data, I then proceeded to visualize the distribution of Content-Encoding values. By counting the occurrence of each encoding, I generated a bar plot. The x-axis represents the different types of Content-Encoding, while the y-axis indicates the count of each type.

```python
content_encoding_counts = data['Content-Encoding'].value_counts()
fig = px.bar(content_encoding_counts_df, x='Content-Encoding', y='Count', title='Distribution of Content-Encoding Values')
pio.write_html(fig, file='contentencoding.html', auto_open=True)
```

<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/contentencoding.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

From the bar plot, one can observe the frequency of each Content-Encoding value across all the links. This provides insights into the types of content encoding most commonly used.

## Distribution of Cache-Control Values

Similarly, I analyzed the Cache-Control header values by generating a pie chart, representing the distribution of Cache-Control values. Each slice of the pie chart represents a different Cache-Control directive, with the size of the slice indicating the frequency of that directive.

```python
cache_control_counts = data['Cache-Control'].value_counts()
fig = px.pie(cache_control_counts_df, names='Cache-Control', values='Count', title='Distribution of Cache-Control Values')
pio.write_html(fig, file='cachecontrol.html', auto_open=True)
```

<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/disturbutioncachecontrol.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

The pie chart provides a visual representation of the frequency of different Cache-Control directives. By studying this, one can understand the caching strategies most frequently implemented.

## Distribution of Expires Values

For the Expires header values, I transformed the data into datetime format and generated a histogram. This histogram shows the distribution of Expires values.

```python
data['Expires'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Expires'], errors='coerce')
fig = px.histogram(data, x='Expires', nbins=50, title='Distribution of Expires Values')
pio.write_html(fig, file='expires.html', auto_open=True)
```

<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/disturbutionexpires.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

The histogram displays the distribution of Expires values across all the links. This can give insights into the duration for which resources are typically cached before they are considered stale.

## Treemap of Cache-Control Directives

To further understand the Cache-Control directives, I created a treemap. Each rectangle in the treemap represents a specific directive, with the size of the rectangle corresponding to the frequency of that directive.

```python
fig = px.treemap(cache_control_counts_df, path=['Cache-Control'], values='Count', title='Treemap of Cache-Control Directives')
pio.write_html(fig, file='treemap.html', auto_open=True)
```

<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/treemapcachecontrol.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

The treemap provides a hierarchical view of Cache-Control directives. It allows us to observe the frequency of different directives in a visually intuitive manner.

## Sunburst Chart of Cache-Control and Content-Encoding Combined

Finally, I created a sunburst chart which combines both Cache-Control and Content-Encoding. This chart allows us to visualize the interrelationships between the two in a hierarchical manner.

```python
data['Combined'] = data['Content-Encoding'] + ' - ' + data['Cache-Control']
fig = px.sunburst(data, path=['Combined'], title='Sunburst Chart of Cache-Control and Content-Encoding Combined')
pio.write_html(fig, file='sunburst.html', auto_open=True)
```

<iframe src="/Web-Analytics/sunburstcachecontrol.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

The sunburst chart displays the relationships between Cache-Control and Content-Encoding. It offers a comprehensive view of how these two parameters interact with each other across all links.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, I have provided a detailed overview of the Cache-Control and Content-Encoding characteristics of the unique links associated with FamPay. The information derived from these metrics can be used to optimize the performance and load time of the application, leading to an enhanced user experience.

This form of analysis can be replicated for other web resources as well. The methodologies and techniques applied here are quite versatile and can provide valuable insights into optimizing web applications.
