    "score: This represents the overall performance score of the website. It is a weighted average of the various performance metrics listed below. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "first_contentful_paint (FCP): This metric measures the time it takes for the first piece of content to be rendered on the screen. It is a key indicator of how quickly users can see and interact with a website's content. Lower values indicate faster rendering times.\n",
    "\n",
    "speed_index: This metric measures how quickly the page's content is visually displayed during the loading process. It is based on the average time at which visible parts of the page are displayed. Lower values indicate faster loading times.\n",
    "\n",
    "largest_contentful_paint (LCP): This metric measures the time it takes for the largest visible element (e.g., an image or text block) to be rendered on the screen. It is an important indicator of user experience, as users often perceive the page to be fully loaded when the main content is visible. Lower values indicate faster rendering times.\n",
    "\n",
    "interactive (also known as Time to Interactive, TTI): This metric measures the time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, meaning that the page has displayed useful content, event handlers are registered, and the page responds to user interactions within 50 milliseconds. Lower values indicate faster interactivity times.\n",
    "\n",
    "total_blocking_time (TBT): This metric measures the total amount of time between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) during which the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness. Lower values indicate less blocking time and a better user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "cumulative_layout_shift (CLS): This metric measures the instability of the page's layout during the loading process. It captures how much visible elements shift around as the page loads, which can be frustrating for users. Lower values indicate a more stable layout and a better user experience."
