    "The cluster map (scatter plot) is a visualization of the clusters formed by the K-Means algorithm on the app reviews dataset. The purpose of the cluster map is to help you understand the distribution and relationships among the data points in a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to interpret the results of the clustering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, the scatter plot displays the data points in a 2-dimensional space, which is achieved by using Incremental PCA for dimensionality reduction. Each point in the plot represents a single app review, and the color of the point indicates the cluster it belongs to, as determined by the K-Means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster map allows you to visually assess the quality of the clustering, identify any patterns or groupings, and evaluate how well the clusters separate the reviews based on their content. By examining the cluster map, you can gain insights into the structure of your data and identify relationships or similarities among the reviews that may not be immediately apparent through other means of analysis."
