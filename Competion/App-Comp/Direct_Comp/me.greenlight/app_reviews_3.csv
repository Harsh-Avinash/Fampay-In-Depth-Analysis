Our children play sports and like to budget paying for their sports lessons and their coaches only take Zelle and Venmo. Which poses an inconvenience because we have to go to the ATM and take out increments of $100 until we have the amount we need to pay for their lessons. This is why I gave green light a three. If this app becomes usable with other apps I would give it five stars.,3,0,5.4.1,2022-12-27 20:24:40,"We are grateful that you took the time out to leave us a review, Stefani.

The app has A LOT of bugs though. Consistently saying it can't reach the network, that it can't connect or logs me out 6 times to make me log in before working. Also.. I received an E-mail a couple days ago saying 20 bonus bucks were going to be added.. still has yet to show up (Not a big deal.. it is free money. Just letting you know).. I can't load money or exchange money through accounts if the app never works...",3,1,1.6.0,2017-08-03 18:24:38,"Hi Alyssa, 
Greenlight does require an internet or WIFI connection and if it's not a strong enough signal, you could experience network issues. Please send us a note at support@greenlightcard.com about the $20 bonus. We'd be happy to look into that for you. It does take some time for us to add the money to your account, but we'll find out asap!",2017-08-12 04:20:18

What is that 4.99 monthly fee.  I like greenlight but the fees is one i don't.,3,3,1.5.1,2017-06-30 06:31:30,"Hey Marie,

The $4.99/mo fee allows us to provide the debit card and all the parental controls. In addition, it covers our cost of providing instant free loads and transfers any time for you. In just a few weeks you'll be able to link your bank account which won't have a minimum load requirement. 

Hope this helps!

Thanks for the feedback. The $50 minimum allows us to eliminate all transfer fees. With that said, we're about to release a feature that will let you link your bank account and there will be no minimum load requirement.

Hope that helps, but please feel free to reach out to us if you have any other questions or feedback!

I think thr company should really consider changing the autofunding. I don't like that $50 is a minimum. I would to be able to put something is my child's account weekly like $5 or $10 week. I'll give this app a chance for alittle while.,3,7,1.4.1,2017-06-06 08:26:40,"Hey there!

Thanks for your feedback. We're actually just a few weeks away from adding a feature that lets you link your checking account with Greenlight. There will be no minimums with that so you can easily add a smaller amount. 

Please let us know if you have any other questions or thoughts!
