No access to Atlanta Georgia staff or board members. It is a ripoff to steal your kids money especially on the savings and investment angle. Another way for the rich to be richer but now on the backs of children. Most of the time the card is declined. Under their bylaws if you complain they can terminate your account so customer service is last on their mind.,1,0,4.27.0,2022-03-29 01:50:33,We pride ourselves on providing a safe and easy-to-use product to help families manage their finances.
