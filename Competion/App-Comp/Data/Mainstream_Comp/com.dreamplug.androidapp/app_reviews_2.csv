The cashback is now in the form of jackpot and all you earn is Cred coins which may not be useful. I had given a feedback that the cashback offer can be more when you pay a higher amount. It hasn't been considered of course and still you get 03 INR cashback for a bill payment of 10000 INR. There are competitive apps like Amazon which goes upto 25 INR for a similar transaction.

Started using the app since its initial days. Loved it then because of it's simplistic design and good rewards, both of which have gone downhill now. The UI is getting complicated with each update and rewards are useless. Moreover, I have noticed that there is a delay in payment reaching the bank for transactions of above Rs 20k. Sometimes it takes upto 2 days and the customer care is of no help. I prefer using the Banks' app now.",2,291,3.0.5.4,2022-05-28 20:17:42,"

But, as a rewarding app, it's just pure hype. More often than not, you get better deals in Amazon and Flipkart. Their jackpots are all ploy - haven't seen anyone winning these jackpots except once - more like a lottery. PS: In one of the credit card bill payment notifications, they missed the decimal point amounts. I paid the cc bill without validating against my statement. This was treated as a missed payment from my bank and few months later, my credit score got screwed up. So, verify against your statement everytime or pay a rupee more than what CRED says.",2,142,2.1.18.10,2021-05-15 10:40:05,"

But whenever I open it asks me to use my coins and I am unable to go the home screen unless I burn coins. There is no option to explore it later or come back later for the same.

First debit card payments have steep restrictions and now even though I have coins they are worthless as there is nothing worth to redeem for at the moment. Had a word with back end team and they said they are going to launch new rewards so lets wait and watch. I'll review the rating again. Also they claim that all details except transaction history can be deleted upon request if a user chooses to quit - which is slightly better than how they have chosen to communicate about data on the app. As on 21 Jan In the last update I did on Jan 21, CRED removed the option to pay using debit card for smaller amounts. I was in it for debit card points which is not available for realistic amounts. Also once you add the card, there is no option to delete it. You can at max hide but cred will not let go of your details so that is a risk too. (Edited - post getting a reply from CRED) I would prefer CRED be more transparent.

Now, this review should ideally be a 5-Star.  Reason behind for 2-Star Rating: I have added around 5 cards to CRED on June 2nd and within hours there were suspicious transactions on one card (Issues by IndusInd). This led to the rating.  The last time I used that card for online payments was in May and that's on flipkart and earlier I used this cards mostly on OLA, PAYTM and Amazon.  Thank fully, the bank immediately blocked the transaction and card and hence no losses occurred.  Note: I am an active user of Credit cards for past 7-8 years and this never happened with me. I never did a transaction on sites which are not PCI compliant / genuine.
