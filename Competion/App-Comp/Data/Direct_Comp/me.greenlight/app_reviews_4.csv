Parrent account shows positive value of monies when entered from a funding source. But a negative value when funded back from a child. So both a positive and a negative money amounts are actually incoming into the parent account. Positive, should be into the account. Negative should be out of the account. Not a mix of someone's accounting dream. Child accounts seem to be correct, why is the parent account this way?",4,0,5.7.0,2023-03-13 01:26:49,"Thank you for sharing your experience with us, Jeff!

Don't fall for this app when you try to cancel they give you the run around and keep charging you the fee. My kids didn't invest in stocks but the support keeps replying to my cancelation request saying that i need to sell these non existent stocks and then re request cancelation. And when i reply that we have no stocks they just resend the form letter saying i need to sell stocks before i can cancel. They have been back and forth over the month and now i was charged again... beware,4,1,4.29.0,2022-04-26 02:12:02,"Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Paul.

What I dislike is that you have to contact customer service in order to add a card or change a card. I believe you should have the ability to add up to 4 cards for funding purposes. Nobody wants to contact customer service every time they want to fund the account because we are using different cards. I have many cards and I never know which card I'm going to use so this needs to be fixed. Other than that everything is fantastic.,4,4,,2017-06-10 00:28:34,"Hey there,

Took a couple days communication but they really made it work. Finally I can load money on my daughter's card. Thanks for all your help!   I cannot add money to my daughter's account because it is telling me my debit card is INVALID. what the heck! I've tried customer service and they sent me to another department after 3 minutes if holding I went to voicemail. This was supposed to be convenient. It is not.  Now my daughter is away from home and depending on this for her money and big surprise it won't work. 😡 I'm very frustrated right now,4,4,1.3.9,2017-05-11 05:12:59,"Hi Amanda,
