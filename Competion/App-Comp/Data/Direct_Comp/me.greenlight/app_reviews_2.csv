I love that you can round up the charge and put that into a savings. It is accepted most places but not everywhere. Unfortunately the app is terrible. It freezes up. When clicking on seeing all charges/history it just shows a blank screen and freezes. It doesn't always show all charges either. This hinders the ability to keep track of ones charges. Hopefully the app will improve. It's pointless to have a card if you can't manage the account properly.,2,102,5.2.1,2022-11-19 05:57:07,"Thank you for sharing this with us, Lauren.

I have heard good things from others, and I think this app/card/program will be helpful with my child. BUT the signup process is very ""scammy."" Not only the upsell of trying to get you to sign up for various higher cost plans that include investments (so many push notifications until disabled!) The bigger issue is the ""standard"" vs ""customized"" card. As you are setting up, every step directs you back to the customized card. There is NO WHERE to set up and order a standard card. What they don't tell you anywhere in the process of signing up is that you get a standard card automatically once your bank sync verifies. Indeed, I got a push notification after I was able to verify my bank that told me my ""next step"" was to order the card and it directed me to the customized card. I looked everywhere for how to get the regular card that doesn't cost extra. No info on the app, no confirmation email telling me it was automatically ordered. I texted the number provided on the app for help. To their credit, customer service was quick to get back to me and they let me know that the standard card was automatically ordered. They also went to my account to verify for me that it was indeed in process. Now WHY CAN'T I get that same info on my own account?! This is clearly designed to TRICK YOU into getting the customized card. The app directs you to do that multiple times during the set up. Nowhere does it tell you, that you already have a regular one coming. And you have to actually speak to customer service to verify a standard card was ordered since there was NO CONFIRMATION of this in my email nor in my app. I told customer service to please pass along my feedback as this comes across as, at best, an unclear and frustrating system, and at worst, VERY SHADY. Please change the process to be TRANSPARENT. You shouldn't have to dig so deep to find out that the customized extra fee card is actually....completely optional. I'm sure they make a lot of extra money of this setup but for me, it is a big turnoff. I will look for a system that is more transparent about additional optional fees.",2,26,4.23.0,2022-01-28 03:08:49,We pride ourselves on providing a safe and easy-to-use product to help families manage their finances.

We love it! Never had a any issue and well worth the small monthly fee we pay. UPDATE: I called Greenlight, talked with their technical support who had to reconcile my daughter's account. But in the process 30 cents was lost out of her savings. The support had to give it to ""coding"", but told me I would get a call ""within the hour."" Twelve hours later my phone rang, but I was unable to take the call due to my remote location. When I called back after the weekend expecting to hear the status of the missing change, I was surprised to find out the call was about me ""wanting to update my Google Play review."" I told them that since the issue hasn't been resolved I am not updating my review. At that point I cancelled my daughter's account and moved to a different program. I encourage Greenlight to keep working out their bugs. I hope soon they will have a good product. We are not a good fit for it.

Have a few questions. Does the 30 day trial begin as of sign up or as of card activation? Not too crazy about adding funds to a card PRIOR to receiving it and I notice when I tried to edit my ss# it was impossible which would mean had I entered one character incorrectly I'm out of luck? Or if any errors there's no correcting them? and it seems there are quite a few reviews regarding editing, and login in features. I also think that if I place money on my kids card I'd prefer it to transfer instantly not in 2-3 business day. In that case it may be easier to just hand over a debit card and set rules. So many banks nowadays have notifications and  alerts and transaction history with no monthly fee that it almost makes it difficult to see the perks in this if your child is Responible....I am however going to go for the trial version and update review. I just hope I don't spend $20 then wait 2 weeks for my card and then receive only 2 weeks out of my 30 day trial. I would prefer to receive the card before submitting bank and card info as well as having a true 30 day trial with actual card in hand for 30 days. I do like that there is no charge to reload unlike NetSpend and GreenDot and the savings and chores features sound fun!
